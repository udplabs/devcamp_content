# Welcome to the {devcamp} Intro to CIC Lab

The purpose of this lab is to provide you with a hands-on experience using the Okta Customer Identity Cloud (CIC) service.

Okta CIC enables you to quickly and easily add identity and security services to your custom developed
applications. This allows you to focus on building high quality application experiences and focus your efforts on the
business functions and value that your users expect.

In this roughly 90 minute hands-on lab you will implement Okta CIC identity
and security services with a custom-built application. Your {devcamp} experience will include the following
hands-on topics:

- Rapidly add authentication to custom applications using Okta CIC's New Universal Login (nUL);
- Secure access to an API endpoint leveraging Okta's OAuth 2.0 service;
- Augment an OAuth token with role and permission claims;
- Strengthen your application's security by adding Multi-Factor Authentication;
- Further decorate your access tokens with Actions;

We hope you find the {devcamp} lab both helpful and entertaining. We want to make this experience as interactive
and educational as possible, so feel free to ask questions throughout the session. Your Okta hosts are available after
this workshop to answer any additional questions and can even discuss your specific application requirements and use cases.
Don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks for joining us!
