**Welcome to the {devcamp} Intro to CIS Lab**

The purpose of this lab is to provide you with a hands-on experience using the Okta Customer Identity Solution (CIS) service. Okta enables you to quickly and easily add identity services to your custom applications whether these applications are built for employees, partners, and/or customers.

By leveraging Okta CIS for your identity services, you can focus on building high quality application experiences and focus your efforts on the business functions and value that your users expect. In these labs (approximately 90 minutes) you will implement Okta CIS with a custom-built application. Your {devcamp} experience will include the following hands-on topics:

**This track demonstrates how to:**

- Leverage our comprehensive RESTful APIs to create identities within Okta CIS's directory service

- Rapidly add authentication to your custom application using Okta CIS's hosted SignOn Widget
- Securing access to your API endpoints leveraging Okta CIS's OAuth 2.0 service
- Augment an OAuth token with external data using Okta CIS's Inline Token Hook capabilities
- Strengthen your application security by adding Okta CIS Multi-factor Authentication
- Further decorate your access tokens with Actions.

We hope you find the {devcamp} lab both helpful and entertaining. We want to make this experience as interactive and educational as possible, so feel free to ask questions throughout the session. Your Okta hosts are available after this workshop to answer any additional questions and can even discuss your specific application requirements and use cases so don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks for joining us!
